= Abstract

This document presents a formal model implemented with
#link("https://uppaal.org/")[Uppaal] of search-and-resque scenarios. Inside a
rectangular map of arbitrary size, civilians have to be brought to safety by
either reaching an exit or being assisted by first-responders. Drones surveys
the area and coordinate the rescue efforts by instructing civilians on what to
do. The model then undergoes formal verification to highlight key behavioral
aspects and identify optimal configurations for maximizing civilian safety.
