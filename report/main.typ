= Abstract

This document presents a formal model of search-and-rescue scenarios featuring
drones, civilians, and first-responders. The scenario analyzed involves a fire
outbreak inside a building, modeled using a network of timed automata within the
UPPAAL tool. A fleet of drones is deployed on the scene to instruct human
subjects to assist those in need or request intervention from a first-responder.
The model then undergoes formal verification to ensure correctness, and the
drones' decision-making policy is formally checked to guarantee that survivors
can reach safety.
